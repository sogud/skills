# Required Research Tool Stack

This is an on-demand catalog of source categories and evidence requirements, not a per-run tool inventory or provider-priority policy. Runtime, permissions, output and handling of incomplete evidence follow `SKILL.md` and `references/stages/report-quality.md`. In AgentSpace, market-data selection and fallback belong only to `knowledge/Invest/Reference/Agent行情数据工作流.md`.

The legacy grade/HTML tables below are reference examples, not additional mandatory completion rules. Do not load the entire catalog for an ordinary research question or treat missing unrelated channels as a reason to stop.

Use it together with:

- `source-profiles.md` for required source mix by research object.
- `source-recipes.md` for acquisition order.
- `data-rigor.md` for financial-data and valuation sanity checks.
- `tool-install-sources.md` for canonical install sources.
- `data-providers/*.md` for provider-specific rules.

Core rule:

> Every complete Alpha Research environment must have at least one usable implementation for each required information channel. A single research run may mark a channel as `Not material for this topic`, but it must not pretend that an unavailable relevant channel was checked.

## 1. Setup Mode enum

Use these setup modes when describing each tool or source.

| Setup Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Built-in | The current agent/runtime already provides the capability. |
| Local install | Requires installing a local CLI, package, desktop tool, or browser extension. Do not include concrete install commands in this resource. |
| API key | Requires the user to provide and configure an API key. |
| Web login | Requires the user to sign in on a website. |
| Browser login session | Requires reusing an authenticated browser session after the user logs in. |
| Paid terminal / subscription | Requires paid access such as a financial terminal, research database, or premium data product. |
| Manual fallback | User or agent manually opens the official source and records the result. |

Rules:

- A tool may have multiple setup modes.
- The agent may help plan setup.
- The user must provide API keys, credentials, paid access, or login actions.
- The agent must not bypass access controls, paywalls, login gates, or contractual restrictions.
- If local installation is needed, the agent should use `resources/tool-install-sources.md` for canonical source/package names, propose environment-specific steps, and wait for user confirmation before acting.
- If the user explicitly approves runtime setup, the agent may execute code, scripts, connector setup, or dependency installation for that environment. Do not add those dependencies to this repository unless separately requested.

## 2. Channel Status enum

Use these statuses in setup reviews and source maps.

| Channel Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Available | The channel can be used now. |
| Available with user action | The channel is available after user action, such as login, API key, subscription access, or install confirmation. |
| Missing | No usable implementation is currently available. |
| Not material for this topic | The channel exists in the required stack but is not relevant to this specific research question. |
| Blocked by access / paid source | The channel would be relevant, but current access rights do not allow use. |

Rules:

- Do not collapse these into a boolean available/missing field.
- `Missing` and `Blocked by access / paid source` must become evidence gaps when relevant.
- `Not material for this topic` requires a short reason.

## 3. Source Confidence Tier

Source Confidence Tier ranks the source before claim-level evidence analysis.

| Tier | Name | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Official primary source | Regulator, exchange, government, court, customs, official statistics, official standard body, official procurement system. |
| 2 | Company primary source | Company filing, annual report, IR page, earnings call, presentation, product page, company press release. |
| 3 | Recognized data provider / exchange data | Financial data provider, exchange data product, academic database, patent database, established industry database. |
| 4 | Reputable media / industry report | Reliable financial media, trade publication, consulting report, broker report, industry association report. |
| 5 | Social / forum / influencer narrative | X/Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, 雪球, 股吧, forums, influencers, newsletters, chat groups, unsourced screenshots. |

Rules:

- Tier is source reliability, not claim strength.
- A high-tier source only supports claims it actually states.
- A Tier 1 filing that does not mention a customer cannot prove that customer relationship.
- Tier 5 can identify narrative, rumor origin, and crowding, but cannot close evidence.

## 4. Evidence roles

| Evidence role | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Strong Fact | Direct primary evidence for a specific claim. |
| Numeric baseline | Revenue, margin, valuation, ownership, liquidity, or time-series baseline that should be reconciled to primary sources. |
| Technical basis | Supports physical, engineering, scientific, or standards logic. |
| Event clue | Indicates a recent event that may need primary confirmation. |
| Corroboration | Indirect support that strengthens or weakens a thesis but is not standalone proof. |
| Rumor / narrative clue | Shows market narrative, rumor, crowding, or reflexivity risk. |

## 5. Agent setup protocol

Only when the user requests an environment/setup audit, use this checklist; ordinary research checks only the selected capabilities:

1. Inventory current access and known tools.
2. For each of the 11 required information channels, assign a Channel Status.
3. For every `Missing` channel, propose acceptable tools or source paths from this document.
4. For every `Available with user action` channel, state the needed user action: API key, web login, browser login session, subscription access, or install confirmation.
5. For every local install candidate, use `resources/tool-install-sources.md`, identify canonical source/package names, describe the setup action type, and ask for confirmation before executing any command.
6. If the user approves runtime setup, commands must be scoped to the current environment and must not modify trading/brokerage accounts.
7. For every paid or access-restricted source, ask whether the user has access; do not bypass restrictions.
8. Produce a setup report with channels, available implementations, missing capabilities, and recommended next actions.
9. Do not claim the environment is report-ready if relevant required channels remain `Missing` or `Blocked by access / paid source`.

## 6. Tool selection principles

Use these principles when choosing among acceptable tools:

1. Prefer official primary sources over aggregators.
2. Prefer stable URLs, citations, timestamps, and retrievable originals.
3. Prefer target-market official sources.
4. Prefer tools that preserve provenance.
5. Prefer no-login tools only when evidence quality is equal.
6. Use paid/subscription tools only if the user has access.
7. Use browser automation only when normal fetch/search cannot access the source.
8. Use social tools only for narrative, rumor origin, crowding, or reflexivity.
9. Never upgrade social/news claims without primary confirmation.
10. For wrappers and aggregators, classify evidence by the underlying source, not by wrapper convenience.
11. If a relevant channel is missing, mark the gap instead of fabricating confidence.

## 7. Provenance capture requirements

Use layered provenance. Do not overburden every source, but preserve enough information for later evidence audit.

### All sources

Capture:

- Citation id (`[S1]`, `[S2]`, etc.).
- Source title.
- URL or stable locator.
- Publisher / owner.
- Source Confidence Tier.
- Evidence role.

### Key Fact sources

For any source used to support a key Fact, also capture:

- Publication date, filing date, or reporting period.
- Access date.
- Quoted excerpt, page number, table number, section name, or paragraph locator when possible.

Key Facts in a final report must have a citation id and a URL/stable locator. A search-result snippet is not enough.

### Social / narrative sources

For social or forum sources, also capture:

- Author / handle.
- Timestamp.
- Original post URL or stable screenshot locator.
- The exact claim being made.

## 8. Source freshness rules

| Source type | Freshness rule |
|---|---|
| Filings | Use latest annual report plus latest quarterly/interim report when available. |
| Earnings calls / presentations | Use the latest cycle; compare historical commentary when trend change matters. |
| News / events | Usually prefer last 12 months unless historical context is required. |
| Financial data | Use latest period plus 3–5 year trend when possible. |
| Technical papers | Recent papers matter for frontier claims; older seminal papers are acceptable for basic principles. |
| Patents | Record publication date, assignee, family, and legal status when available. |
| Social narrative | Timestamp is mandatory; stale social claims cannot prove current crowding. |
| Policy | Distinguish draft, consultation, final rule, effective date, and implementation details. |
| Industry reports | Check publication date and data vintage. |

## 9. Market coverage caveat

No tool covers all markets equally.

Rules:

- Match tool coverage to market scope.
- A US-focused tool may be weak for A-share, HK, China policy, or non-US markets.
- A social source strong for US narratives may be weak for China narratives, and vice versa.
- Financial data providers may have delayed, incomplete, restated, or differently standardized data.
- Reconcile important company-level facts to target-market primary sources.

Examples:

- Use SEC EDGAR for US filings, HKEXnews for HK disclosures, 巨潮资讯 and exchanges for A-share disclosures.
- Do not rely on X/Grok alone for A-share narrative; use 雪球、东方财富股吧、互动易、上证 e 互动 when relevant.
- Do not rely on generic news for China policy; use official ministries, regulators, and statistics sources.

## 10. Minimum acceptable evidence by research object

Use this section to decide whether the source plan is sufficient.

### Company research

Required:

- Filing / disclosure.
- Company IR.
- Financial data.
- News / event search.

Useful:

- Social / narrative search.
- Alternative data leads.
- Browser automation if disclosures or investor materials are dynamic.

Quality warning:

- Company research without filings/disclosures is not report-ready.
- Company research without financial data cannot support valuation, quality, liquidity, or balance-sheet discussion.
- Company research that discusses valuation, ranking, or relative priority needs the minimum data pack from `data-rigor.md` or explicit Data Gaps.
- Relative attractiveness claims need a peer/comparable baseline or a clear explanation of why clean peers are unavailable.

### Technology / material research

Required:

- Academic / technical search.
- Patent / standards search.
- Industry / market sources.
- Company exposure evidence for any mapped public company.

Useful:

- Alternative data leads.
- News / events.
- Procurement / tender data where commercialization depends on projects.

Quality warning:

- Do not use news or social media to establish technical feasibility.
- Papers explain technical possibility; they do not prove company revenue.

### Industry / supply-chain research

Required:

- Industry and market sources.
- Company filings / IR for mapped companies.
- Financial data for exposure and purity.
- News / events.

Useful:

- Trade / customs data.
- Procurement / tender data.
- Alternative data leads.
- Browser automation for supplier directories or dynamic databases.

Quality warning:

- Do not classify a company as a chokepoint without exposure and purity evidence.

### Policy / macro research

Required:

- Official policy source.
- Official statistics or macro data source.
- Industry / association data where relevant.
- News only as event clue.

Useful:

- Trade / customs data.
- Procurement / subsidy data.
- Local government sources.

Quality warning:

- Distinguish draft policy, final policy, implementation rules, and actual funding.

### Commodity / macro commodity research

Required:

- Commodity-specific official data source for supply, demand, inventory, reserves, or flows.
- Futures / benchmark source when price, curve, spread, contango, backwardation, or roll yield is discussed.
- Positioning / flow source when crowding, speculative length, ETF flow, or market-structure risk is discussed.
- Macro source when rates, FX, inflation, or growth drive the thesis.
- Company filings / IR and financial data for any commodity-linked candidate/company recommendation.

Useful:

- Shipping, sanctions, policy, weather, refinery, rig count, and trade data where material.
- Paid commodity terminals or datasets when the user has access.
- Browser automation for exchange tables or dynamic dashboards.

Quality warning:

- Price charts and news headlines are not enough for commodity research.
- Futures curve and positioning are market-structure evidence; they are not standalone proof of physical fundamentals.
- Commodity-linked company recommendations require both the commodity driver and company exposure evidence.

### Narrative / anti-hype research

Required:

- Original narrative source.
- Social / narrative search.
- Primary source confirmation or rejection.
- Thesis Audit evidence audit.
- Thesis Audit bear-case evidence.

Useful:

- Price / liquidity / ownership data.
- News timeline.
- Browser automation for social or forum sources.

Quality warning:

- Narrative research without original narrative capture cannot claim to have tested hype.

## 13. Hard source gate rules

These rules constrain Alpha Research before a final report can be produced.

Hard source gate status is not a grade. It is a pass/fail gate.

A missing required source blocks claims that depend on it. Report exact gaps without presenting the research as complete; independent findings may still be delivered. If core evidence is missing, state that the question cannot be answered. Markdown/HTML format does not change this rule.

| Hard gate failure | Applies when | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| No Source Registry exists | Any Alpha Research final report | Stop. Build Source Registry first. |
| Key Facts lack citation ids with URL / stable locator | Any Alpha Research final report | Stop. Collect previewable sources or stable locators. |
| Final citations would not be clickable | Any final HTML report | Stop. Convert Source Registry entries to clickable inline citations and bibliography links. |
| Local artifact cited as proof for external Fact | Any final HTML report | Stop. Replace local report/source-map links with the original source URLs used by that artifact. |
| Evidence comes only from web search snippets | Any Alpha Research final report with key Facts | Stop. Open the real page, filing, PDF, data endpoint, original post, or official source. |
| Filing / disclosure source missing | Company research or listed-company map | Stop for company conclusions. Fetch official filing/disclosure or remove company-level conclusions. |
| Financial baseline missing | Company research or public-company ranking | Stop for valuation/quality/purity ranking. Fetch financial data or remove ranking. |
| Company IR / primary company source missing | Product, customer, deployment, roadmap, or management claim | Stop for that claim. Fetch company source or downgrade/remove the claim. |
| Technical source missing | Technology, material, semiconductor, biotech, or engineering-heavy thesis | Stop for technical feasibility claims. Fetch paper, standard, patent, or official technical source. |
| Market-specific official source missing | US / HK / A-share / China policy / other market facts | Stop for those market-specific facts. Use target-market official source. |
| Top chokepoint lacks direct evidence | Industry / supply-chain research | Stop before ranking it as a core chokepoint. Add evidence or demote to hypothesis. |
| Commodity balance source missing | Commodity / macro commodity research | Stop before making supply/demand/inventory conclusions. Add official or recognized commodity data. |
| Futures curve / positioning source missing | Commodity curve, roll-yield, contango/backwardation, or crowding claim | Stop before making market-structure conclusions. Add exchange/CFTC/flow source or remove claim. |
| Commodity-linked company exposure missing | Candidate/company recommendation tied to commodity driver | Stop before recommending the company. Add filings/IR/financial baseline and exposure logic. |
| Original narrative source missing | Anti-hype mode | Stop before claiming narrative origin/crowding path. Find earliest visible source or mark unknown. |
| OpenCLI/browser/social/manual narrative capture missing | Anti-hype mode with social/forum/narrative claims | Stop before claiming origin or crowding path. Use an original source capture path, or mark the channel blocked and ask for user approval/access. |
| Financial data source missing | Company ranking, valuation, liquidity, or candidate comparison | Stop before ranking or valuation discussion. Use yfinance, a-stock-data, Funda, TradingView, official filings/exchange data, or documented manual equivalent. |
| Aggregator/wrapper cited as primary proof | Any key Fact | Stop. Preserve original source provenance or downgrade to baseline/corroboration. |

Allowed blocked output:

- `source-gate.md`, `tool-status.md`, or a clearly marked section in `source-map.md` / `report-quality.md`.
- Missing source list.
- Source Acquisition Plan.
- Questions for the user: API key, login, subscription, browser session, or permission to run approved setup commands.

Disallowed blocked output:

- A polished final report with confident conclusions.
- Company priority ranking based on missing filings/financial data.
- Strong Facts without previewable citations.

## 14. Quality ceiling rules

These rules constrain `Report Quality` stage after the hard source gate passes.

They are report quality limits, not investment ratings.

| Condition | Maximum Quality Grade | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Any relevant required channel is `Missing` | B | Source coverage is incomplete. |
| Any relevant required channel is `Blocked by access / paid source` and no substitute exists | B | Access gap may hide important evidence. |
| Filing / disclosure access is missing for company research | C | Company research lacks primary disclosure. |
| Company IR is missing for company research | B | Management and product context are incomplete. |
| Financial data is missing for company research | C | Numeric baseline is insufficient. |
| Academic / technical search is missing for technology, material, biotech, semiconductor, or engineering-heavy topics | C | Technical basis cannot be validated. |
| Patent / standards search is missing when technical moat or standard adoption is central | B | Technical route and moat analysis is incomplete. |
| Social / narrative search is missing for anti-hype mode | B | Narrative origin and crowding were not checked. |
| Market-specific official sources are not checked for the target market | C | Wrong-market evidence risk. |
| Commodity-specific official/recognized data is missing for commodity balance claims | C | Supply/demand/inventory thesis lacks commodity data. |
| Futures curve or positioning data is missing when curve/crowding is central | B | Market-structure analysis is incomplete. |
| Commodity-linked company recommendation lacks filings/IR/financial baseline | C | Candidate logic lacks company-level proof. |
| Most key claims rely on news or social sources without primary confirmation | D | Mostly narrative. |
| Source provenance is unclear for key Facts | C | Claims are not auditable. |
| Key Facts lack citation ids with URL / stable locator | C | Readers cannot preview or verify the data. |
| Final HTML citations are not clickable | C | Readers cannot verify claims from the report. |
| Local artifacts are cited as proof for external Facts | C | The report points to process output instead of original evidence. |
| A wrapper or aggregator is cited without original source provenance for key Facts | C | Tool output is not auditable enough for primary claims. |
| Signal/flow/hot-tag/chart data is used as fundamental proof | D | Market-structure or narrative data was upgraded beyond what it can prove. |
| Anti-hype narrative origin is discussed without OpenCLI/browser/social/manual original-source capture | C | Narrative/crowding path is not auditable. |
| Company ranking or valuation uses only articles/search summaries and no financial data source | C | Numeric baseline is not reliable enough. |
| Key source dates are stale or unknown for time-sensitive claims | C | Freshness risk. |

Rules:

- Quality Grade A requires no material source-channel gaps for the selected research object.
- Quality Grade B may still have evidence gaps, but they must be explicit and non-fatal.
- Quality Grade C means more source work is needed before the report should be treated as reliable.
- Quality Grade D means the report is mostly narrative or not acceptable as research.

## 15. Required setup output

A setup review should produce:

| Channel | Channel Status | Available implementation | Setup Mode | Missing capability / user action | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Web search |  |  |  |  |  |
| Web / PDF fetch |  |  |  |  |  |
| Filing / disclosure |  |  |  |  |  |
| Company IR |  |  |  |  |  |
| Financial data |  |  |  |  |  |
| Academic / technical |  |  |  |  |  |
| Patent / standards |  |  |  |  |  |
| News / event |  |  |  |  |  |
| Social / narrative |  |  |  |  |  |
| Browser automation |  |  |  |  |  |
| Alternative data leads |  |  |  |  |  |

## 16. Final rule

Information quality determines research quality.

A beautiful report built from weak sources is still weak research.
